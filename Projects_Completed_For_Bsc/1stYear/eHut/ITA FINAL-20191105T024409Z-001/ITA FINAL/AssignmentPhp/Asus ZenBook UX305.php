  <h2>Asus ZenBook UX305</h2>

<p  style="text-align:justify">If you're looking for a Windows alternative to Apple's latest rose-tinted MacBook, the Asus ZenBook UX305 might be more your speed. 
Though it looks like a Cupertino design from every angle, it's actually superior to Apple's creations in almost every way. 
From its purple-tinged aluminum design to its sharp display and hearty helping of built-in storage space, the UX305 puts Windows back in style, fanless design, long battery life and all. 
And, while the low-cost is enticing, if you're shopping for something with a bit more horsepower (not to mention an even more compact design), look no further than the Asus ZenBook 3.
