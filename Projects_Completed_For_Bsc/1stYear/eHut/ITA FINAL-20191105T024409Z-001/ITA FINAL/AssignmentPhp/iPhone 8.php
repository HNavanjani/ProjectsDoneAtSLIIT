  <h2>iPhone 8</h2>

<p  style="text-align:justify">
With this year's iPhone set to mark the 10th anniversary of Apple's smartphone lineup, speculation is rife that the firm has something big in store.
If rumours are to be believed, Apple has three smartphones up its sleeve - the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus and iPhone 8. The latter, also referred to as the iPhone 'Edition', looks set to be the most exciting, with leaks pointing to an AMOLED display, an all-glass construction and built-in wireless charging support. There's also talk that the iPhone 8 will be the first to support wireless charging and a Touch ID sensor embedded in its display/ 
Apple's iPhone 8, along with the 7S and 7S Plus, likely will debut in September.
