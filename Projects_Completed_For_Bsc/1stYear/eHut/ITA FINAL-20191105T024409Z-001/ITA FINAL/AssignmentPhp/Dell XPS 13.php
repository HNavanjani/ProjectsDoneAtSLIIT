<h2>Dell XPS 13</h2>

<p  style="text-align:justify">
The Dell XPS 13 is the best laptop money can buy


With the 2016 model, the Dell XPS 13 reigns supreme as the best laptop you can buy today. 
Thin and light with a battery life that exceeds 7 hours, according to our movie test, Dellâ€™s flagship laptop is the posterchild for Ultrabooks. 
Once again, too, Dell has managed to squeeze a 13.3-inch screen into an 11-inch frame, proving the nigh-borderless InfinityEdge display to be a design marvel. Outfitted with Intelâ€™s latest Kaby Lake processors and lightning-fast storage and memory, the Dell XPS 13 is dressed to impress with welcome addition of a Rose Gold color option as well. It should comes as no surprise, then, that we still rank it as the best Ultrabook and best laptop overall.
